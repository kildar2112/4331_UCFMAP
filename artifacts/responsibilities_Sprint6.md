| Nick P | Continued work on Interactive Map(SVG), Managed repo structure, Continued updates architecture.md to reflect additional design changes, setup AWS S3 and Lambda | Updating our architecture was necessary to more accurately reflect the final project.

Lambda allows us to run functions for the website without our own dedicated server. Both AWS services required configuration for group access. |
