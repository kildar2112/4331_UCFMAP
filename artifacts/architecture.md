In the first level of the diagram, the user, highlighted in green, accesses the website to view parking availability and travel times from the garage the user desires to park in to his or her class. The website, represented by a blue square, indicating it is software being developed, uses two existing software systems: Google Maps and UCF Parking Services. The user is able to view parking availability on the website when that information is retrieved from UCF Parking Services. Additionally, the user is able to view travel times on the website, which uses Google Maps to provide that information.

The second level of the diagram, the user, highlighted in green, visits http://my.ucfparkingmap.wtf/ to view park space and travel times. The software, which is represented by the large, square outline, is represented at this level by two parts. Firstly, the Web Application portion, which is made in HTML, is where the user views parking availability and travel times. This portion also retrieves information from UCF Parking Services. The Web Application makes calls to the Google Maps API, which provides travel times and a route to class.

![Filter and Building class diagram](https://github.com/kildar2112/4331_UCFMAP/blob/master/artifacts/imgs/UML/cd_buiding_processor.jpg?raw=true)
This diagram shows the links between the filter that is put over the UCF map and the buildings, garages, and route that users will be able to see.

CLASS DESCRIPTIONS

Building:
	The class that represents a UCF Building, which contains its location and the    option to enable or disable visibility on the map. It contains two public methods that turn the visibility on or off. Its location is also kept track of by a Point.

Garage:
	A type of building that records how full the garage is, which garage it is, and what permits are needed to park in it. It inherits from the Building class and contains a few private methods, which update the fullness of the garage, calculate the percentage of spots available, and change the color that represents how full a garage is (e.g. a red garage is full). In addition, its fields record what its current color is, how many spots it has, how many are available, and what permits are accepted at that garage.

Processor:
	The class that processes all of the data taken from the UCF Parking Services. It contains arrays that store all of the current data for the garages. This class will also send the data to S3 which is used for storing the data so we can calculate peak hours for the garages. We can also validate the data coming in to make sure that we aren't pulling in garbage data if UCF Parking Services is down for any period of time.

Data Design
===
It is our current intent to use Heroku as our application's host and to store permanent data logs using Amazon's S3 services. Due to the nature of our host's ephemeral filesystem, we'll need to frequently backup our program's data logs elsewhere. We intend on [reading from a bucket](https://www.ashishpaliwal.com/blog/2015/02/amazon-s3-reading-file-content-from-s3-bucket-in-java/) on program startup and saving logs to it at the end of a data cycle. We intend to setup the data logging in such a way that the most up to date and valid information is available for viewing on the website. In order to accomplish this we must develop the system in such a way that if invalid data is recorded, a halt will be placed on the corrupted data being displayed on the website.

Business Rules
===
There are no known business rules that apply to our project.

User Interface Design
===
![User Interface Diagram](https://github.com/kildar2112/4331_UCFMAP/blob/master/artifacts/imgs/garages/popup.jpg?raw=true)
The Map:
	The map will have clickable icons for each building and garage. The user will be able to click buildings and receive information about them, such as their fullness if it is a garage, or location and distance if it is a classroom. The garages on the map will also be color-coded to represent their fullness, so that the user will know how full a garage is before they click on it.

User Interface Description:

Garage Availability:
	The user will be able to view how many parking spots are open and what percentage of spots are available by simply looking at this section. It contains a list of all the garages, and when the user clicks on a garage, that garage will be highlighted on the map.

Filter by Parking Permit:
	The user will be able to see where he or she can park by filtering the garages by permits. In other words, they will know what permits are accepted in which garages. The user will select the permit they have and a list of valid garages will be displayed.

Walk to Class / Bike to Class:
	The user will select one of these two options before they receive a travel time and route. The user will simply click the box corresponding to their travel method, which will let Google Maps know how the user wishes to get to class.

Select Classroom Building:
	The user will select the classroom building they wish to go to from a dropdown menu. This will let Google Maps know where the userâ€™s destination is.

Show route:
	The user will click  the box next to this if they wish to see a route to get to their chosen building. If the user does not click this, the user will receive instead only an estimated travel time.

Go to Google Maps:
	The user will click this and will be shown an estimated travel time and route depending on the options they chose above.

Resource Management
===
At this time we do not have any concerns with resource management. Should we encounter issues regarding resource management during development, we will update this section.

Security
===
For our own security, we have decided to buy our hosting platform as to avoid making ourselves vulnerable to malicious activity.

Performance
===
We have not foreseen any performance issues in our design mockups yet. We'll keep you updated.

Scalability
===
Thanks to the nature of Heroku, S3, and the fact that minimal data is stored on the back end, we should be able to scale up the app to handle traffic exceeding the total population of UCF students and staff.

Interoperability
===
While we don't have any plans for the information we produce to be utilized by another party, we will be operating our program based on the information received by [UCF Parking's Garage Availability page](https://parking.ucf.edu/garage-availability/).

Internationalization/Localization
===
Given our project is local to the UCF Orlando campus, there are no plans for supporting anything beyond local usage. Our website's primary supported language will be English, but we do have tentative plans for including an additional language option, Spanish.

Input/Output
===
The system will be receiving input from UCF Parking Services and will be reading and writing to Amazon's S3. At this time we have no intention of storing any data input by a user.

Fault Tolerance
===
Since we're using 3rd party data, we must insure that we have a very narrow fault tolerance in respects to the data we allow our system to digest. If any changes to the source of our data is made, we have to be able to verify that the data we are receiving is still valid. If a change has been made that breaks the system, our error processing needs to be able to handle it and notify us, the development team.

Error Processing
===
If the system receives invalid data from a 3rd party, it cannot commit them to a valid log file. It must be processed and stored for debugging. If at some point the incoming data stream changes is such a way, the system must go into a safety/lockdown state that prevents valid logs from corruption and invalid data from being displayed to the user.


Architectural Feasibility
===
As we near a completed architecture, we will evaluate our architecture as a whole and update this section.

Overengineering
===
We currently do not have plans to overengineer our product as a whole. The intent for the popular hours calculator is to build it in such a way that it can be functional independent of input source... In other words, it should functional outside of the scope of our project with minimal modifications.

Build-vs-Buy Decisions
===
Rather than build a server to host our program, we decided to outsource virtually all of our program's hardware requirements. We're using Heroku to run our application and will be using Amazon's S3 service to store our permanent data/files.

Reuse
===
We do not currently have any plans for reusing any part of our project elsewhere. As we develop it, we will do our best to compartmentalize our code to make parts reusable in other projects.

Change Strategy
===
Assuming we embrace the agile mindset, any changes we make should be embraced with minimal friction.
