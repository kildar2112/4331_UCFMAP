# Manual Parking Pass Test

1) Go to this [link](my.ucfparkingmap.wtf) or open a new tab and type
my.ucfparkingmap.wtf into the search bar.

2) When the screen loads, click anywhere on the screen to get past the Don't Text and Drive screen.

3) Click on any garage. A pop-up window should appear

4) Look at the "Accepted Permits" section.

5) Go to [Parking Services](https://map.ucf.edu/parking/) and ensure that the listed permits are the same as the ones
on the UCF Parking Website. You will see a map in the UCF Parking Services website, which has color-coded garages to represent which
permits are accepted where. The map will look like this:
